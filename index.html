			<p class="bold">What is pole dancing</p>
			<p>Most people think of shady strip clubs when you hear “Pole Dancing?” Time to  revisit. Pole dance fitness has become the new and trendy workout. </p>
			<p>Pole Dancing is a type of exercise that combines acrobatics, gymnastics and dance. It requires flexibility and upper body and core strength, as well as endurance. The moves include climbs, spins, inversions and limb grips, and thus is a very versatile form of exercise. Pole dance techniques are often combined with aerobics to improve your control and positioning on the pole, and making sure you are always getting the most of your workout.</p>

		<div class="paragraph_two">
			<p class="bold">Who can Pole dance</p>
			<p>Everyone! People of all shapes, sizes, experience levels and athletic capabilities can practice Pole Dancing, uncluding pregnant women and children. <p>You can start at any level and work your way up as quickly or as slowly as you need to. It is important that you are in the right physical condition to work out and that your doctor is approving you doing this sort of exercise. </p>Many studios have defined classes at different levels of experience, so you can work with people of your same skill level and improve together.</p>

		<div class="paragraph_three">
			<p class="bold">How to get started</p>
			<p>If you are a beginner and aren’t quite ready to invest in specialized clothing, you can wear spandex shorts  that are above the knees and a sleeveless top and sports bra to your first session. Once you decide if you like the sport then you can invest in pole clothing.</p>
			<p>One very important thing to remember is not to use any lotion or moisturizer on the day of your training, as it will negatively affect your ability to grip the pole. It could result in a dangerous, or, at the very least, a very frustrating class.</p>
